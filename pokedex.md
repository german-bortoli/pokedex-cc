# Pokedex clone ðŸ‘¾
This test consists of buildign a pokedex clone.

A pokedex is a fictitious object that lists information about pokemons. Pokemons are small animal-like monsters (poket-monster) that user collected and battle against other pokemons, taken from the [Pokemon game serires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)). You'll need to consume [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) to make a paginated list of pokemons, with a detail page and a mocked "add pokemon" feature.

The goal of this project is to make an example of how you work. We are not looking for a perfect implementation, we'll get to chat about the project in the next interview. It's intented to be built within a week without full dedication.

# Scope
It must have a paginated list of all pokemon. Clicking on one of them must render a details page of a pokemon. It should have an "add pokemon feature" that doesn't use the API.

We are intentionally vague on some details to leave room for you to build whatever you think its best.

You must work in a public git repository.

While design is not the main focus in this project, we do apreciate a nice design. But please don't spend too much time here.

Have a Readme.md with running instructions and decitions you have taken (specially around adding a pokemon). If blocked, reach out to dsisto at blockchain dot com.

## Nice to have features
- responsiveness
- error handling
- testing
